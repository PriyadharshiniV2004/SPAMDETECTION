# SPAMDETECTION
This idea is to detect the spam message using ML techniques
# Steps Followed
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaned the text data using regex and basic text operations.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Used **TF-IDF** to convert text to numerical vectors.
3. **Model**: Trained a **Naive Bayes classifier** with hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**.
4. **Evaluation**: The model achieved an accuracy of **X.XX%**.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **SMS Spam Collection Dataset** from Kaggle.

# How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.
